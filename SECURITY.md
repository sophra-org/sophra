### Security Measures

Sophra implements a comprehensive security model including:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for user sessions and API key authentication for service-to-service communication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control and permission checks to ensure only authorized users have access to sensitive data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Request Validation**: Validates incoming requests to prevent malformed or malicious data.
- **Automatic Token Rotation**: Regularly rotates tokens to minimize the risk of token-based attacks.
- **Security Audit Logging**: Logs security-related events for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly updates dependencies to ensure the latest security patches are applied.

### Security Best Practices

To maintain a secure environment, follow these best practices:

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure your passwords are strong and unique for each service.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by enabling 2FA.
- **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your software to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor System Logs**: Regularly monitor system logs for any suspicious activity.
